# Engineering-Portfolio

Welcome to my technical portfolio. This GitHub repository showcases a curated selection of hands-on projects, academic work, and practical engineering tasks developed throughout my university studies in Industrial Engineering (Mechanical Engineering specialization), as well as my experience as an active team member of a Formula Student competition team.

## 🎯 About This Portfolio

This repository includes:

- 📘 **University projects** – Key assignments and simulations in mechanics, CAD, dynamics, materials, and control systems.
- 🛠️ **Formula Student experience** – A summary of my contributions and examples of tasks completed within a Formula Student team (while respecting confidentiality agreements).
- 📄 **Theses** – Final projects or theses work focused on the implementation of IA to create personalized prostheses or the development of a portable h2 gas filling station (currently being develop).
- 💡 **Engineering mindset** – An overview of how I approach design, problem-solving, teamwork, and iteration in complex environments.

Each folder contains relevant documentation, visualizations, simplified models, or code snippets to provide insight into the type and depth of work I’ve done.

## 💼 Why This Portfolio?

I created this portfolio to provide a transparent and organized look into my technical background and learning journey. It is intended for recruiters, hiring managers, and professionals seeking candidates with strong engineering fundamentals, practical project experience, and a hands-on mindset. With this repository it would be easier to show how I can adapt to different engineering fields thanks to my experience and formation.

If you're reviewing this repository as part of a job application, thank you for your time and interest.
