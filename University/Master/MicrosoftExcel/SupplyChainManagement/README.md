# ðŸ“¦ Excel â€“ Supply Chain Management

This folder contains projects developed using **Excel** for the *Supply Chain Management* course.

The projects focus on analyzing and optimizing various aspects of supply chains, including inventory management, demand forecasting and logistics. Using Excel, we developed models to simulate and evaluate the efficiency of different supply chain strategies, considering factors like lead times, transportation costs and stock levels. The goal was to design cost-effective and efficient supply chains while minimizing risks and delays.

### Key Features:
- **Inventory Management**: Optimization of inventory levels using demand forecasting and replenishment models.
- **Demand Forecasting**: Analysis of historical data to predict future demand and adjust inventory levels accordingly.
- **Logistics Optimization**: Modeling of transportation costs, delivery schedules and route planning to improve supply chain efficiency.

ðŸ“‚ All files are academic exercises created for educational purposes, showcasing the application of data analysis and optimization techniques in supply chain management.
