# ðŸ”¥ Excel â€“ Thermal Machines and Heat Engines 2

This folder contains projects developed using **Excel** for the *Thermal Machines and Heat Engines 2* course.

The project focuses on analyzing and optimizing the design of a **heat engine** based on real data and measurements. Using Excel, we developed models to simulate the engine's performance, including parameters such as **thermal efficiency**, **fuel consumption**, **power output**, and **temperature variations**. The goal was to optimize the engine's design for maximum performance and efficiency under various operating conditions.

### Key Features:
- **Performance Analysis**: Simulation and analysis of key performance indicators like efficiency, fuel consumption and power output.
- **Optimization**: Optimization of engine parameters (e.g., compression ratio, working fluid, heat exchangers) to improve efficiency and reduce fuel consumption.
- **Data-driven Design**: Incorporating real-world data and measurements into the analysis to ensure the model's accuracy and applicability to practical engine designs.

ðŸ“‚ All files are academic exercises created for educational purposes, showcasing the application of data analysis and optimization techniques in the design of thermal machines and heat engines.
