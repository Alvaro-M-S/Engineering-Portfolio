# üå¨Ô∏è Excel ‚Äì Energy Sources

This folder contains projects developed using **Excel** for the *Energy Sources* course.

The focus of the project was on the creation and feasibility study of a **wind farm** in **Vitoria**. Using Excel, we analyzed key parameters for determining the viability of the wind farm, including **wind turbine size**, **energy extraction potential** and other critical factors that influence the performance and sustainability of wind energy production. The goal was to assess the economic and environmental impact of the project and optimize the design based on local conditions.

### Key Features:
- **Wind Turbine Size**: Calculation of optimal turbine size based on local wind conditions to maximize energy production.
- **Energy Extraction**: Estimation of the energy that can be extracted from the wind farm, factoring in wind speed, turbine efficiency and other environmental conditions.
- **Feasibility Analysis**: Economic analysis and evaluation of the cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits of the wind farm project.

üìÇ All files are academic exercises created for educational purposes, demonstrating the application of data analysis and optimization techniques in the field of renewable energy.
