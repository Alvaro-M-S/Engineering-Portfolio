# ðŸŽ¶ Proyecto Ingenia â€“ Interactive Music and Light System

This folder contains the documentation, code, photos, and videos for the **Proyecto Ingenia** developed as part of the *Ingenia* course.

The project aimed to integrate electronics, sensors, lighting and music to create an interactive system. We used a **Kinect sensor** to capture motion, and with custom code written in **Processing (Java)**, we developed an interactive interface that responded to user movements with music and lighting effects. The goal was to simulate a **mixing table** or an **electronic drum kit**, where the user could trigger sounds and control lighting based on their movements.

### My Contributions:

- **LED Control**: I was responsible for designing, soldering and implementing the LED control system using **Arduino**. The LEDs were programmed to respond to different actions, enhancing the user experience with dynamic lighting effects.
- **Kinect Integration**: Alongside a colleague, I worked on controlling the Kinect sensor with **Processing (Java)** to capture motion and trigger different sounds or music based on the userâ€™s movements.

ðŸ“‚ All files and documentation here showcase the integration of electronics, software, and interactive design used to create an engaging multimedia experience.

ðŸ“¸ **Photos and Videos**: Included are photos and videos showing the final result of the project, demonstrating the system in action and how it responds to user interaction with lights and music.
