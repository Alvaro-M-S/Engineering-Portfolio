# ðŸ”§ LTSpice â€“ Electronic Systems Design

This folder contains projects developed using **LTSpice** for the *Electronic Systems Design* course.

The project focuses on simulating the various electronic components of an autonomous home cleaning robot. Using LTSpice, we implemented and simulated the behavior of the robot's sensors, actuators and control circuits, analyzing their response in different simulated environments. The goal was to optimize the robot's performance by testing how it would interact with different sensor inputs and how the electronic system would react to environmental changes.

### Key Features:
- **Simulation of Robot Components**: The robot's sensors and control circuits were modeled in LTSpice and the system's response was simulated in various home environments.
- **Testing in Simulated Environments**: We tested how the robotâ€™s electronics responded to different sensor inputs, including obstacles and floor variations, to ensure its autonomous functionality.

ðŸ“‚ All files and documentation here showcase the application of LTSpice in designing and simulating electronic systems for autonomous robots.
