# ðŸŽ“ Master's Degree Projects â€“ Advanced Engineering

This folder contains selected projects developed during my **Master's Degree** in Industrial Engineering.

In the Master's program, we get deeper into the technical aspects of engineering, exploring advanced topics in areas such as systems design, optimization, and cutting-edge technologies. Additionally, the program emphasizes the importance of **organization**, **standards and regulations**, and **project and team management**. A key component of the Master's curriculum is the development of an **entrepreneurial mindset**, preparing students for leadership roles within engineering teams and companies.

ðŸ“‚ All files represent the advanced technical and managerial knowledge gained throughout my Master's studies and demonstrate my ability to apply both engineering principles and business acumen in real-world scenarios.
