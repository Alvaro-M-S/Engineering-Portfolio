# 🏭 FlexSim – Integrated Manufacturing

This folder contains projects developed using **FlexSim** for the *Integrated Manufacturing* course.

The projects focus on simulating and analyzing manufacturing systems, with an emphasis on improving efficiency, reducing costs, and optimizing workflows. FlexSim was used to model and simulate production lines, supply chains, and logistics systems, helping to identify bottlenecks, resource allocation issues, and potential improvements in real-world manufacturing environments.

📂 All files are academic exercises created for educational purposes, demonstrating the application of simulation techniques in integrated manufacturing systems.
