# üõ†Ô∏è MATLAB ‚Äì Control and Automation

This folder contains projects developed using **MATLAB** for the *Control and Automation* course.

The focus of the course was on advanced control techniques, including **PID control**, **system stability** and **automated control systems**. In these projects, MATLAB was used to model and simulate dynamic systems, design and tune PID controllers, and analyze the system's response to various control strategies. The goal was to understand the principles of feedback control and apply them to real-world automation problems.

### Key Features:
- **PID Control**: Designing and tuning **Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)** controllers for a variety of dynamic systems to achieve optimal performance.
- **System Stability and Response**: Analyzing the stability and response of controlled systems, ensuring that the system remains stable under varying operating conditions.
- **Simulation**: Using MATLAB to simulate the behavior of control systems and their performance, optimizing them for specific tasks and responding to disturbances.

üìÇ All files are academic exercises created for educational purposes, demonstrating the application of advanced control techniques and system automation in engineering problems.
