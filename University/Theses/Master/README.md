# âš¡ Master Thesis â€“ Viability and Design of a Portable H2 Charging Station

This folder contains the research, design, and findings related to my **Master's Thesis** on the **viability and design of a portable hydrogen (H2) charging station**. The goal of this project is to develop a solution capable of efficiently and rapidly charging hydrogen-powered vehicles, specifically **two trucks**, each requiring **18 kg of H2**.

### Project Overview:
The portable hydrogen charging station is designed to:
- **Supply H2** to two trucks simultaneously, with a capacity to fill each truck with **18 kg of H2**.
- The station will utilize **deposits and pressure differences** for the charging process, aiming for a **fast charging time** of under **15 minutes** per truck.
- The station is designed to support **two different final pressures** for the trucks: **350 bar** and **700 bar**.
- **Hydrogen generation**: The system will produce H2 **in situ**, allowing the station to be connected to the grid and operate autonomously for hydrogen generation when needed.

### Key Features:
- **Portable Design**: A compact and mobile charging station that can be deployed in various locations.
- **Hydrogen Supply and Pressure Control**: The system will manage the precise delivery of H2 gas to meet the specific needs of each truck at different pressure levels (350 bar or 700 bar).
- **Fast Charging (< 15 minutes)**: Optimizing the hydrogen supply process to ensure rapid refueling times.
- **In Situ Hydrogen Generation**: The station will be capable of generating H2 locally, reducing reliance on external supply sources.
- **Grid Connection**: The system can connect to the grid for reliable hydrogen production and refueling capability.
