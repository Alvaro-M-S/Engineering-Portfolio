# ðŸ”Œ Electronic Fundamentals â€“ Arduino Projects

This folder contains basic Arduino-based projects developed as part of the course *Electronic Fundamentals*.

The course introduced key concepts in electronics, including circuit theory, sensors, actuators, and **microcontroller programming**. Arduino was used to implement and test simple control systems and logic functions in practical lab settings.

ðŸ“‚ All projects are academic and simplified for illustrative purposes only.
