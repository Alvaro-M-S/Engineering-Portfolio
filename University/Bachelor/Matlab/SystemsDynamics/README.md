# ðŸ”„ MATLAB â€“ System Dynamics

This folder contains MATLAB projects developed for the *System Dynamics* course.

The projects focus on the foundational concepts of system dynamics and control theory, including **transfer functions**, **PID controllers**, and **system stability analysis**. MATLAB was used to model dynamic systems, analyze their response, and design control systems to meet specific performance criteria.

ðŸ“‚ All files are academic exercises created for educational purposes, demonstrating the application of system dynamics and control techniques.
