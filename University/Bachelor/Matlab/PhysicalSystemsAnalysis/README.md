# ðŸ”¬ MATLAB â€“ Physical Systems Analysis

This folder contains MATLAB projects developed for the *Physical Systems Analysis* course.

The projects focus on the **Finite Element Method (FEM)** from scratch, understanding its mathematical foundation, and applying it to solve **heat transfer** and **stress analysis** problems. Simulations include solving partial differential equations (PDEs) for thermal and mechanical systems using FEM principles.

ðŸ“‚ All files are academic exercises created for educational purposes and to demonstrate the implementation of FEM and physical system analysis.
