# ðŸ”§ MATLAB & Simulink â€“ Control Fundamentals

This folder contains MATLAB and **Simulink** projects developed for the *Control Fundamentals* course.

The projects focus on designing and simulating control systems, including PID controllers, system stability analysis, and dynamic response simulations. Simulink was used for modeling control systems, while MATLAB was used for numerical analysis and algorithm implementation.

ðŸ“‚ All files are academic simulations created for educational purposes and demonstration.
