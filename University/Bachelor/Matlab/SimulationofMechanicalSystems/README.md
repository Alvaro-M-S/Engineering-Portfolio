# ðŸ”© MATLAB â€“ Simulation of Mechanical Systems

This folder contains MATLAB projects developed for the *Simulation of Mechanical Systems* course.

The projects focus on simulating the behavior of mechanical systems, including kinematic analysis, dynamic modeling, and system response simulations. MATLAB was used to solve differential equations, model forces and motions, and analyze the dynamic performance of mechanical structures and components.

ðŸ“‚ All files are academic exercises created for educational purposes and to demonstrate the application of simulation techniques in mechanical systems.
