# 🏗️ Structural Analysis – ANSYS Projects

This folder includes selected simulations and structural analysis tasks completed using **ANSYS** for the course *Structural Analysis*.

The projects explore the behavior of components under stress, deformation and temperature variations, focusing on mechanical design validation through Finite Element Analysis (FEA).

📂 All examples are simplified academic exercises intended for demonstration only.
