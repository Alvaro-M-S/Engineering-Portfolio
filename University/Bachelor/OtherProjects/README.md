# ðŸ“‚ Others â€“ Various Projects

This folder contains a collection of various projects, both individual and group-based, developed throughout my academic journey.

The projects include detailed work on:

- **Plant Design**: Planning, layout and optimization of manufacturing plants, including process flow and resource management.
- **Part Manufacturing**: Design, fabrication and testing of mechanical components, with a focus on material selection, manufacturing methods and quality control.

These projects demonstrate my ability to apply engineering principles to real-world problems and work effectively in both individual and collaborative environments.

ðŸ“‚ All files are simplified academic exercises created for educational purposes and to demonstrate the application of engineering concepts in industrial design and manufacturing.
