## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

The goal of this section is to showcase:

- My academic foundation and technical versatility.
- My ability to approach and solve complex problems across multiple engineering domains.
- The hands-on mindset that complements my theoretical training.

This portfolio reflects the kind of broad, systems-level thinking that an Industrial Engineer brings to cross-functional teams in real-world projects.
