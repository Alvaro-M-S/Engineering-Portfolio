# 🏎️ Formula Student – Practical Experience

This folder contains a selection of basic and non-confidential tasks related to my work as a member of a Formula Student team during three seasons.

As a core contributor (and later captain) I took part in a wide range of technical, hands-on, and organizational tasks. My role evolved over the years, culminating in team leadership responsibilities during the 2023/24 season.

## 🔧 Summary of Contributions

### 📅 2021/2022 Season

#### 🔵 Cooling
- Studied, selected, and sourced air purge valves for the cooling circuit (based on efficiency, materials, standards and cost).
- Prepared and assembled cooling systems for testing.
- Calibrated NTC sensors for PCB cooling design.
- Updated CAD models on the car's model in 3DExperience-CATIA; implemented parts into the car and prepared drawings/renders.
- Sealed electric motor housings.
- Analyzed pressure loss in the inverter's cooling circuit (Excel).

#### 🟠 Aerodynamics
- Measured vehicle center of gravity (CG).
- Designed sidepod and analysed (ANSYS/Fluent - 2D) airflow redirection to improve inverter's radiator cooling.
- Contributed to the mid-zone design (floor + new flow entries to enhance downforce).
- Collaborated on 3D CFD simulation of sidetrays/venturi in SimScale.
- Assembled mid-zone aerodynamic components.
- Prepared cutting tables for lamination (AutoCAD).

#### 🟣 Composites / INTA
- Assisted INTA with drone fuselage.
- Carried out suspension bar testing (carbon fiber).
- Prepared molds for Monocoque 05.
- Laminated the outer layer of Monocoque 05.
- Performed CNC cutting for sidepod laminates.
- Laminated material samples and mid-zone parts.

#### ⚙️ General
- Supported Cost and Design documentation. Static events of the competition where you have to explained why you designed or chose between different option in terms of engineering solution/performance and economical difference or aspects.
- Assisted other mechanical divisions and car assembly.
- Helped when needed. Always offering a hand or help.

## 📂 Content Notes

This folder contains only a **limited and simplified set of references or summaries**. No sensitive data, simulations, or CAD files have been shared. The files included are **basic and for illustrative purposes only**, to demonstrate the **variety and scope** of tasks I have performed across seasons and divisions.

If you're a recruiter or engineering manager, I’ll be happy to explain these projects further in an interview.
